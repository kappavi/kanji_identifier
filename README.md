todo:

- figure out text wrapping on front end nad make kanji display prettier 
- hammer out front end
- dealing with kanji that arent in WK but are in jisho
-  (later) think about using jisho api instead / alongside rn for word parsing as opposed to kanji look up
- think about permanent caching all requests and just accessing those since not that many unique request possible
----> this is if we stick with wanikani api, with jishi api too many unique requests
